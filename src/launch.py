 @mainpage OpenShot Video Editor 2.0
 
 Welcome to the OpenShot Video Editor 2.0 PyQt5 documentation. OpenShot was developed to
 make high-quality video editing and animation solutions freely available to the world. With a focus
 on stability, performance, and ease-of-use, we believe OpenShot is the best cross-platform,
 open-source video editing application in the world!
 
 This documentation is auto-generated by Doxygen, using the doxypy Python filter. If you are 
 interested in how OpenShot Video Editor is designed, feel free to dive in, because this 
 documentation was built just for you. If you are not a developer, please feel free to visit
 our main website (http://www.openshot.org/download/), and download a copy today for Linux, Mac, or Windows.
