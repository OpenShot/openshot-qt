On Linux:

1: Install the libopenshot and libopenshot-audio libraries and their dependencies. Install python3-zmq or pyzmq (whichever is inside of your package manager). Optional: Install pip3 or equivalent.
2: Download the latest release and unpack if applicable.
3a: Run "sudo pip3 install --upgrade openshot-qt".
3b: Alternatively, if you are using another package manager, like porg, you can run "python3 setup.py build" and "python3 setup.py install".

If you have an error when trying to run openshot-qt like this:
"ImportError: libopenshot.so.19: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
You'll need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. You probably need to set it like this: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib"
