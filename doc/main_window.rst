For step-by-step instructions on the basic usage of OpenShot, be sure to read the
:ref:`quick_tutorial_ref`.

Built-in Tutorial
-----------------
When you first launch OpenShot, you will be presented with a friendly built-in tutorial. It will point out and explain
the basics. Clicking **Next** will jump to the next topic. You can always view this tutorial again from the **Help\â†’Tutorial** menu.

.. _tracks_ref:

Tracks & Layers
------------------

OpenShot uses tracks to layer videos and images. The top most track is the top layer, and the bottom track is the bottom layer.
If you are familiar with layers in a photo editing application, then you should be quite familiar with this concept.
OpenShot will mix each layer together, just like a photo editing application. You can have an unlimited number of tracks, but
typically a video project will not need more than 10 (or so) tracks.

For example, imagine a 3 track video project

   #   Name                Description
   ==  ==================  ============
   1   Top Track           Clips on this track will always be on top and visible
   2   Middle Track        Clips in the middle (might or might not be visible, depending on what is above them)
   3   Bottom Track        Clips on this track will always be on the bottom
