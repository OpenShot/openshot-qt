System Requirements
-------------------
Video editing uses sizeable amounts of memory, modern multi-core CPUs, and fast internal storage.  There are various specifications you will want to check when reviewing computers for video editing.  Check the memory, processor, graphics card, and storage.

Most over-the-counter computers max out at 32GB RAM, so it is always best to have as much memory as possible.  You will also want a powerful processor.  The best on the market is the Intel Core series (i7 and higher) and the AMD Ryzen series (R7 and higher), but you can manage using any processor with a speed of 2.5 gigahertz (GHz) or higher.  Finally, you will want to make sure you have plenty of storage available to hold the software and video footage with which you will be working.  Your best bet is to use a computer that has over 1.0 TB of storage but, failing that, anything with at least 500 GB is suitable.

When editing video with OpenShot, you want a computer system that meets these **minimum** system requirements:

* 64-bit Multi-core processor
* 4 GB of Random-Access Memory (RAM)
* 500 MB of free storage space for installation
* 500 GB of internal storage space for processing
* Internal or discrete Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
* 64-bit Operating System (Linux, macOS, Windows 64-bit)
* Monitor or laptop display capable of 1280x720 (720P) resolution
* Optional: Solid-state drive (SSD), if using disk-caching (and an additional 10GB of hard-disk space)
