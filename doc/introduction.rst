System Requirements
-------------------

Video editing uses sizable amounts of memory, modern multi-core CPUs, and 
fast internal storage.  There are various specifications you will want to 
check when reviewing computers for video editing.  Check the memory, 
processor, graphics card, and storage.

Most over-the-counter computers max out at 32GB RAM, so it is always best to 
have as much memory as possible.  You will also want a powerful processor.  
You can manage using any processor with a speed of 2.5 gigahertz (GHz) or 
higher.  Finally, you will want to make sure you have plenty of storage 
available to hold the software and video footage with which you will be 
working.  Your best bet is to use a computer with more than 1.0 TB of storage 
but, failing that, anything with at least 500 GB is suitable.


When editing video with OpenShot, you want a computer system that meets these 
**minimum system requirements**:

- 64-bit Multi-core processor
- 4 GB of Random-Access Memory (RAM)
- 500 MB of free storage space for installation
- 500 GB of internal storage space for processing
- Internal or discrete Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
- 64-bit Operating System (Linux, macOS, Windows 64-bit)
- Monitor or laptop display capable of 1280x720 (720P) resolution
- Optional: Solid-state drive (SSD), if using disk-caching (and an additional 
  10GB of hard-disk space)

A more in depth version of the System Requirements is available in the 
`User Manual <manual.html#system-requirements>`__.
