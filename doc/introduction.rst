System Requirements
-------------------

Video editing uses sizable amounts of memory, modern multi-core CPUs, and 
fast internal storage.  It is always best to have as much memory as possible.  
You will also want a powerful processor.  You can manage using any processor 
with a speed of 2.4 gigahertz (GHz) or higher.  Finally, you will want to make 
sure you have plenty of storage available to hold the software and video 
with which you will be working.  A Solid State Device (SSD) provides faster 
disk access which helps when finalizing your project.  Most modern computers 
should work well with OpenShot™.

When editing video with OpenShot™, you want a computer system that meets these 
**minimum system requirements**:

- 64-bit Multi-core processor (2.4+ GHz)
- 4 GB of Random-Access Memory (RAM)
- 500 MB of free storage space for installation
- 500 GB of internal storage space for processing
- 64-bit Operating System (Linux, macOS, Windows 64-bit)
- Monitor or laptop display capable of 1280x720 (720P) resolution

A more in depth version of the System Requirements is available in the 
`User Manual <manual.html#system-requirements>`_.
