We are working hard to expand this user guide and to improve OpenShot Video Editor, but if you are stuck and don't know where to turn, OpenShot has several sources for additional information.

 #. OpenShot has several `YouTube videos <https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=openshot+video+editor+jonathan+thomas>`_ available to help you see how to use the application.
 #. OpenShot has a `Reddit Community <https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenShot/>`_ dedicated to users helping users with questions about the video editor and computer-related issues.
