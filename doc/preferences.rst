Preferences
===========
The Preferences window is where you modify all settings concerning OpenShot.
They can be found in the top menu under **Editâ†’Preferences**.
You will need to restart OpenShot after your changes are applied. 
After installation, you need to set the paths for Blender and Inkscape under the General tab if you want to use them.  
Also, check the audio settings under the Preview tab.  Make sure they are the same as your system, or you may experience sound issues during preview/playback.

   Windows: disable audio enhancements/microphone recognition


Autosave
--------

.. image:: images/preferences-3-autosave.png

Autosave is a saving function in OpenShot which automatically saves the current changes or progress to your project, helping to reduce the risk or impact of data loss in case of a crash, freeze or user error.

When loading projects from older versions of OpenShot, you may want to terporary disable Autosave to see if they work. This to prevent them from being automatically overwritten by a broken version.

Cache
-----

.. image:: images/preferences-4-cache.png

A cache is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster.

.. TODO Cache settings
  CacheMode - When to use Disk? Servers?
  Cache Limit (MB): How much % of RAM advised? Different for iGPU vs dedicated GPU?
  Image Format: What is PPM/XMB/XPM? Where is this used for? 
  Scale Factor: ??
  Image Quality: ??

Debug
-----

.. image:: images/preferences-5-debug.png

Here you can modify how much data should be logged. Normally, *Debug Mode (verbose)* is off.
The default port is 5556
If you want to help improve the program you can enable **Send Anonymous Metrics and Errors**.

Performance
-----------
.. image:: images/preferences-6-performance.png

Please keep in mind that hardware accelleration is experimental at the moment.
For more information take a look at our `Github <https://github.com/OpenShot/libopenshot/blob/develop/doc/HW-ACCEL.md>`_
It may be best to test each modification directly after changing so you remember what was changed if you experience issues.

.. TODO Performance settings
  Process Video Frame Rates in Parallel
  OMP Threads = Open Multi-Processing? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP
  FFmpeg Threads 
        (NB: it states 0=default, but the actualy default upon installation is 8 ?)
         Advices is N(cores-1) or N(Threads-1) ?
 Hardware Decoder max width/height  Can be found where? Link to HW manufacturers?
 Use Blender GPU rendering: Default = on?
    (May be default in Blender 2.8? - 
    May work backfire if system has multiple GPUs and high-end GPU recognizes Blender automatically)
        

Keyboard
--------
.. image:: images/preferences-7-keyboard.png

This is where hotkeys can be seen and re-assigned, as described under 
:ref:`keyboard_shortcut_ref`.
