Preferences
===========
The Preferences menu is where you modify all settings concerning OpenShot.
They can be found in the menu under **Editâ†’Preferences**.
You will need to restart OpenShot before changes are applied. 
After installation, you need to set the paths for Blender and Inkscape under the General if you want to use them.  
Also check if the audio settings under Preview are the same as your system, or you may experience sound issues during playback. 


General
-------

.. image:: images/preferences-1-general.png


Preview
-------

.. image:: images/preferences-2-preview.png

Here you can set the default Video Profile, but you can always choose a different one at the start of your project. More about :ref:`profiles`

Here you can choose which connected audio device should be used by OpenShot. 
If you experience sound issues, make sure your audio settings are the same as your audio card.
The default audio sample rate of your sound device can be found under the sound device settings from your operating system. 

.. TODO:: Add to FAQ, add Link [WIKI tag AUDIO + FAQ ?] here.  
   For more info check our FAQ on the wiki.
   Windows: disable audio enhancements/microphone recognition


Autosave
--------

.. image:: images/preferences-3-autosave.png

When loading in projects from older versions of OpenShot, you may want to terporary disable Autosave to see if they work. This to prevent them from being automatically overwritten by a broken version. 
.. Advise SuslikV on github https://github.com/OpenShot/openshot-qt/issues/3334

Cache

.. image:: images/preferences-4-cache.png
.. TODO:: Cache settings
  CacheMode - When to use Disk? Servers?

  Scale Factor: ??
  Image Quality: ??

Debug
-----

.. image:: images/preferences-5-debug.png
Here you can modify how much data should be logged. Normally, *Debug Mode (verbose)* is off.
The default port is 5556

.. image:: images/preferences-6-performance.png

Please keep in mind that hardware accelleration is experimental at the moment.
For more information take a look at our `Github<https://github.com/OpenShot/libopenshot/blob/develop/doc/HW-ACCEL.md>`_
It may be best to test each modification directly after changing so you remember what was changed if you experience issues.

.. TODO:: Performance settings
  Process Video Frame Rates in Parallel
  OMP Threads = Open Multi-Processing? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP
  FFmpeg Threads 
        (NB: it states 0=default, but the actualy default upon installation is 8 ?)
         Advices is N(cores-1) or N(Threads-1) ?
 Hardware Decoder max width/height  Can be found where? Link to HW manufacturers?
 Use Blender GPU rendering: Default = on?
    (May be default in Blender 2.8? - 
    May work backfire if system has multiple GPUs and high-end GPU recognizes Blender automatically)
