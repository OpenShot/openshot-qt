Quick Tutorial
==============

Using OpenShot is very easy, and this tutorial will take you through the basics in
**under 5 minutes**. After this tutorial, you will be able to make a simple photo
slide-show with music.

Step 1 – Import Photos & Music
------------------------------
Before we can begin making a video, we need to import files into OpenShot. Drag and
drop a few images (\*.JPG, \*.PNG, etc...) and a music file (most formats will work)
from your Desktop to OpenShot. Be sure to drop the files where the
arrow in the illustration is pointing to.

Step 2 – Arrange Photos on Timeline
------------------------------------
Next, drag each photo onto the timeline (as seen in the illustration). The timeline represents
your final video, so arrange your photos in whatever sequence you want them to appear in your
video. If you overlap two clips, OpenShot will automatically create a smooth fade between them,
displayed by blue rounded rectangles between the clips. Remember, you can rearrange the clips
as many times as needed by simply dragging and dropping them.

Step 3 – Add Music to Timeline
------------------------------
To make our photo slide-show more interesting, we need to add some music. You should have
imported a music file in step 1. Click on the music file, and drag it onto the timeline. If
the song is too long, grab the right edge of your music clip, and resize it smaller.

Step 4 – Preview your Project
------------------------------
To preview what our video looks & sounds like, click the Play button under the preview window.
You can also pause, rewind, and fast-forward your video project by clicking the corresponding
buttons.

Step 5 – Export your Video
---------------------------
Once you are happy with your photo slide-show video, the next step is to export your video.
This will convert your OpenShot project into a single video file, which will work on most
media players (such as VLC) or websites (such as YouTube, Vimeo, etc...).

Click on the Export Video icon at the top of the screen (or use the **File > Export Video** menu).
Choose from one of the many preset export options, and click the *Export Video* button.

You should now have a basic understanding of how OpenShot works. Importing, Arranging,
Previewing, and Exporting. Hopefully this tutorial took less than 5 minutes for you to
complete. Please read the rest of this guide for a more detailed understanding of OpenShot,
and it's advanced features. Enjoy!
