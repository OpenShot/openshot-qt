Quick Tutorial
==============

Using OpenShot is very easy to use, and it has many advanced features.  This tutorial will take you through some basic steps in **under 5 minutes**.  After this tutorial, you will be able to make a simple photo slide-show with music.

Definitions
-----------
Clip:
   Each media file you add to the OpenShot timeline is called a clip.
Project:
   All of the files, transitions, effects and animations that you make or use within OpenShot.
Profile:
   A profile is a collection of common video settings (size, frame rate, aspect ratio, etc…).
Animation:
   The technique of making inanimate objects or drawings appear to move in motion pictures or computer graphics.
Transition:
   A transition is used to gradually fade (or wipe) between two clips.

Step 1 – Import Photos & Music
------------------------------
Before we can begin making a video, we need to import files into OpenShot.  Drag and drop a few images (\*.JPG, \*.PNG, etc.) and a music file (\*.MP3, \*. WAV, etc.) from your file manager or desktop to OpenShot.  You can add your clips to the timeline as well as the Project Files list.  Be sure to drop the files to where the arrow in the illustration is pointing.

Step 2 – Add and Arrange Photos to Timeline
------------------------------------
Next, drag each photo to the timeline (as seen in the illustration).  The timeline represents your final video, so arrange your photos in the order you want them to appear in your video.  If you overlap two clips, OpenShot will automatically create a smooth fade transition between them, displayed by blue rounded rectangles between the clips.  Remember, you can rearrange the clips as many times as needed by simply dragging and dropping.

Step 3 – Add Music to Timeline
------------------------------
To make your photo slide-show more interesting, we need to add some music.  You should have imported a music file in Step 1. Click on the music file, and drag it to the timeline.  If the song is too long, click the right edge of your music clip and drag it to the left to make your clip shorter.

Step 4 – Preview your Project
------------------------------
To preview how your video looks & sounds, click the Play button under the Preview window.  You can also pause, rewind, and fast-forward your video project by clicking the corresponding buttons.

Step 5 - Refine and adjust you video
------------------------------------
OpenShot has many advanced features to enhance your project.  You can use :ref:`titles` to add title screen or text to your clips.  :ref:`transitions` will gradually fade one clip to another.  :ref:`animation_ref`s can change the properties of a clip over time.  These changes can be even more refined using the Properties window (CTRL+I).  For more information, use the menu to the left to find the related topics.

Step 6 – Export your Video
---------------------------
Once you have edited your photo slide-show video, the last step is to export the project.  This will convert your OpenShot project into a single video file.  Using the default settings, the video will work on most media players (such as VLC) or websites (such as YouTube, Vimeo, etc.).

Click the Export Video icon in the top toolbarn (Press CTRL+E or use the **File > Export Video** menu).  Choose from one of the many preset export options, and click the *Export Video* button.
