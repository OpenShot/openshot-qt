Mac, and Windows can be downloaded fromm the official download page at

Most Linux distributions have a version of OpenShot in their software
repositories, so installation should be easy. Some might have an
outdated version though (make sure to check the version number). The
easiest way to ensure you have the very latest version, is to download
an AppImage from the `project website
<https://www.openshot.org/download/>`_. Once downloaded, right click on
the AppImage file, choose Properties, and mark the file as
**Executable**. Now, go ahead and double click the AppImage to launch
it.

Mac
^^^

Download the DMG file from the `project website
<https://www.openshot.org/download/>`_, double click it, and then drag
the OpenShot application icon into your **Applications**
shortcut. This is very similar to how most other Mac applications are
installed. Now launch OpenShot from Launchpad.

Windows
^^^^^^^

Download the Windows installer executable from the `project website
<https://www.openshot.org/download/>`_, double click it, and follow the
directions on screen. Once completed, OpenShot will be installed and
available in your Start menu.
