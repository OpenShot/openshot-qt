Files
=====

To create a video, we need to make media files available to our project by importing files
into OpenShot. Most media file types are recognized, such as videos, images, and audio files.
Files can be viewed and managed in the **Project Files** panel.

Note that imported files are not copied anywhere, they remain in the physical location they
were before and are simply being made available to your video project. So, they must not be
deleted or moved after adding them to your project. The "Show All", "Video", "Audio",
"Image" filters above the files allows you to only see the file types you are interested in. You can also toggle the view between details and thumbnails view of your files.

Split Clip
----------
If you need to cut a file into many smaller clips before editing, the **Split Clip** dialog is built exactly for this
purpose. Right click on a file, and choose Split Clip... from the file menu. This opens the Split Clip dialog. Use this
dialog to quickly cut out as many small clips as you need. The dialog stays open after you create a clip, to allow you
to repeat the steps for your next clip. When you are finished, simply close the dialog.

   #   Name                Description
   ==  ==================  ============
   1   Start of Clip       Choose the starting frame of your clip by clicking this button
   2   End of Clip         Choose the ending frame of your clip by clicking this button
   3   Name of Clip        Enter an optional name
   4   Create Clip         Create the clip (which resets this dialog, so you can repeat these steps for each clip)
   ==  ==================  ============

Please refer to the section :ref:`clips_cutting_slicing_ref` for more ways to cut and slice clips directly in the timeline.

Add to Timeline
---------------
In certain cases, you might need to add many files to the timeline at the same time. For example, a photo slide show,
or a large number of short video clips. The **Add to Timeline** dialog can automate this task for you. First, select
all files you need to add, right click, and choose Add to Timeline.

   2   Order of Files      Use these buttons to reorder the list of files (move up, move down, randomize, remove)
   3   Timeline Position   Choose the starting position and track where these files need to be inserted on the timeline
   4   Fade Options        Fade in, fade out, both, or none
   5   Zoom Options        Zoom in, zoom out, or none
   6   Transitions         Choose a specific transition to use between files, random, or none
   ==  ==================  ============

Properties
----------
To view the properties of any imported file in your video project, right click on the file, and choose **File Properties**.
This will launch the file properties dialog, which displays information about your media file. For certain types of images
(i.e. image sequences), you can adjust the frame rate on this dialog also.

.. _file_remove_ref:

Remove from Project
-------------------

This will remove a file from the project. It will not delete the underlying physical file though, so removing a file from the project merely makes it unavailable for this video project.
