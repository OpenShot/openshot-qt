Files

Before we can begin making a video, we need to import files into OpenShot. Most media file types are
recognized, such as videos, images, and audio files. Files can be viewed and managed in the **Project Files** panel.

There are many ways to import media files into OpenShot.

Split Clip
----------
If you need to cut a file into many smaller clips before editing, the **Split Clip** dialog is built exactly for this
purpose. Right click on a file, and choose Split Clip... from the file menu. This opens the Split Clip dialog. Use this
dialog to quickly cut out as many small clips as you need. The dialog stays open after you create a clip, to allow you
to repeat the steps for your next clip. When you are finished, simply close the dialog.

==  ==================  ============
1   Start of Clip       Choose the starting frame of your clip by clicking this button
2   End of Clip         Choose the ending frame of your clip by clicking this button
3   Name of Clip        Enter an optional name
4   Create Clip         Create the clip (which resets this dialog, so you can repeat these steps for each clip)
==  ==================  ============

Add to Timeline
---------------
In certain cases, you might need to add many files to the timeline at the same time. For example, a photo slide show,
or a large number of short video clips. The **Add to Timeline** dialog can automate this task for you. First, select
all files you need to add, right click, and choose Add to Timeline.

6   Transitions         Choose a specific transition to use between files, random, or none
==  ==================  ============

Properties
----------
To view the properties of any imported file in your video project, right click on the file, and choose **File Properties**.
This will launch the file properties dialog, which displays information about your media file. For certain types of images
(i.e. image sequences), you can adjust the frame rate on this dialog also.
