Glossary
===========
Animation:
   The technique of making inanimate objects or drawings appear to move in motion pictures or computer graphics.
Aspect Ratio:
   The ratio of width to height in a flat surface or 2-dimensional abstract construction, such as an image, character, or pixel.  4:3 (or 1.33:1) is the standard ratio for NTSC video.  1.85:1 and 2.35:1 are the most common aspect ratios for motion pictures.
Bitrate:
   The frequency at which bits (binary digits) pass a given physical or metaphorical point, measured in bps (bits per second).
Clip:
   Media files that you add to the OpenShot timeline are called clips.
Compositing:
   Construction of a composite image by combining multiple images and other elements.
Crop Factor:
   Crop factor is a number (typically from 1.3-2.0) that represents the ratio of a sensor's imaging area to that of a full-frame sensor.  Try multiplying the focal length of your lens by your camera sensor's crop factor.  It gives you the focal length for the lens/sensor combination.
Frame Rate:
   The frame rate is the rate that your shutter cycles through opening and closing or when the sensor captures video in a 1 second period.  Common Frame Rate Examples: 24, 25, 29.97, 30, 50, 60. We express the frame rate in frames per second (fps).
Pixel Aspect Ratio:
   Pixels are the thousands of tiny squares that make up each image in your video.  While aspect ratio is the ratio between the width and height of your video, the Pixel Aspect Ratio is the ratio between the width and height of the pixels.  A common Pixel Aspect Ratio is 1:1.
Project:
   A project is all the files, transitions, effects, and animations that you make or use within OpenShot.
Resolution:
   Resolution refers to the actual number of horizontal and vertical pixels your video contains.  Common resolution Examples: (SD) 640×480, (HD) 854x480, (HD) 1280×720, (HD) 1920×1080.  Often, the resolution is referred to by only the number of pixels that appear vertically.  The examples listed would appear as 480p, 720p, and 1080p, respectively.
Sync (Synchronization):
   A production is synchronized when the audio aligns with the video imaging.
Transition:
   Use a transition to fade (or wipe) between two clips gradually.
