Glossary
===========
There is much technical terminology in today's fast-moving media-centric world.  If you find yourself wondering what a video production term or an acronym means, you are certainly not alone.  Like most industries, video production has a language all its own.  Here is a list of terms commonly found in video editing.  Becoming familiar with these terms only makes your job easier.

A-Roll:
   The Principal video that is usually someone speaking. 
Aliasing:
   The undesirable jagged or stair-stepped appearance of angled lines in an image, graphic, or text. 
Alpha:
   Alpha blending is a convex combination of two colors allowing for transparency effects in computer graphics.  The value of alpha in the color code ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 represents a fully transparent color, and 1.0 represents a fully opaque color.
Alpha Channel:
   An alpha channel is a channel in an image or movie clip that controls the opacity region.
Ambient Noise:
   Ambient noise is background noise specific to the shooting location.
Animation:
   The technique of making inanimate objects or drawings appear to move in motion pictures or computer graphics.
Anti-Aliasing:
   Anti-aliasing is a process for smoothing jagged lines in an image.  Anti-aliasing can also mean a method of filtering out erroneous frequencies in an audio signal.
Artifact:
   An artifact is undesired data in an image because of digital processing.
Aspect Ratio:
   The ratio of width to height in a flat surface or 2-dimensional abstract construction, such as an image, video, character, or pixel.  The standard ratios for NTSC SD videos are 4:3 (or 1.33:1) and HD 16:9 (or 1.77:1).  The most common aspect ratios for motion pictures are 1.85:1 and 2.35:1.
ATSC:
   ATSC is a digital broadcast standard that replaced the older analog NTSC standard.  The standard covers both standard and high-definition formats.
Audio Sample Rate:
   The number of samples taken per second to reproduce audio digitally.  The higher the sample rate, the higher the quality of the digital audio.  A rate of 44,100 samples per second produces CD-quality audio and captures the range of human hearing.

B-roll: 
   B-roll is supplemental footage that provides supporting details and greater flexibility when editing video.  Common examples include the footage used to cut away from an interview or news report to help tell the story.
Bit:
   The elementary unit for digital storage.  A BIT can be either a 1 (one) or a 0 (zero).
Bit Depth:
   In digital graphics and video, bit depth indicates the number of colors an image can display.  A high-contrast (no gray tones) black and white image is 1bit, meaning it can be off or on, black or white.  As bit depth increases, more colors become available.  24-bit color allows for displays of millions of colors.  Similarly, in digital audio, bit depth indicates the number of bits per sample.  The higher the number, the better the sound quality.
Bitrate:
   The frequency at which bits (binary digits) pass a given physical or metaphorical point, measured in bps (bits per second).  For every second in the video, the Bit Rate, or Data Rate, is the amount of data used each second.  The bitrate, in Kilobits per second, can be variable or constant.
Blue Screen:
   A blue screen is a blue background that the subject stands in front of that the computer later replaces with another background in post-production.  See also blue screen compositing and green screen.
Blue Screen Compositing:
   The process of making all blue elements in an image transparent and placing a different background underneath.

Capture:
   The process of transferring source video from a camcorder or tape deck to a computer.  If the source video is analog, the capture process converts the video to digital.
Channel:
   A channel is one of several grayscale components used to make up a color image.  Red, green, and blue channels make up RGB images, with an optional alpha channel for transparency.
Chromakey:
   Chromakey is a method of creating transparency in a video source by selecting a specific "key color" to create an alpha matte.  It is frequently used on news programs to display weather graphics behind talent and for visual effects compositing.
Clip:
   A digitized or captured portion of video, audio, or both.  Clips are media files added to the Timeline, usually part of a more extensive recording.
Codec:
   Codec is a video compression technology used to compress data in a video file.  Codec stands for "Compression Decompression." An example of a popular codec is H.264.
Color Correction:
   The process of altering the color of a video, especially one shot under less than ideal conditions, such as low light.
Compositing:
   Construction of a composite image by combining multiple images and other elements.
Coverage:
   Coverage is the process of shooting additional footage and camera angles to cover the action in the scene.  Coverage is so that the editor has a more excellent range of choices when the film reaches the post-production stage.
Compression:
   The process of reducing data, such as in an audio or video file, into a form that requires less space.
Crop Factor:
   Crop factor is a number (typically from 1.3-2.0) that represents the ratio of a sensor's imaging area to that of a full-frame sensor.  Try multiplying the focal length of your lens by your camera sensor's crop factor.  It gives you the focal length for the lens/sensor combination.
Crawl:
   Crawl is a text effect where the text moves right-to-left (in the English-speaking world).
Cross-fade:
   A cross-fade is a simultaneous fade-in of one audio or video source as another fades out so that they overlap temporarily.  Also called a dissolve.
Cut:
   A cut is an instantaneous change from one shot to another.
Cut-in (Insert Shot): 
   It is a type of shot that most often shows the objects the subject is in contact with or manipulating.  Cut-in shots are correspondingly helpful to b-roll because they stray from the subject for a short time.
Cutting on Action:
   Cutting on action is a technique used to create a more interesting scene. The concept is simple… when you cut in the middle of an action, it will appear less jarring and more visual interesting.

Data Rate:
   The amount of data moved over time (for example, 10 MB per second).  Often used to describe a hard drive's ability to retrieve and deliver information.
Denominator:
   The number or expression below the line in a fraction (such as 2 in ½).
Digital Video:
   Digital video is an electronic representation of moving visual images (video) in the form of encoded digital data.  In contrast, analog video represents moving visual images with analog signals.  Digital video comprises a series of digital images displayed in rapid succession.
Digitize:
   To convert analog video or audio to digital form.
Dissolve:
   Dissolve is an image transition effect where one picture gradually disappears as another appears.  Also called a cross-fade.
