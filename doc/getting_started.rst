Getting Started
===============

.. image:: images/getting-started.png

You do not need to be a trained videographer to understand how to create videos 
well.  Simple editing can keep your viewers engaged longer, and add a 
professional feel, even if you are not a professional video editor.

Basically, video editing is taking footage, cutting it up, removing the 
pieces you do not want, and keeping the bits you do.  Back in the old days, 
editing was slicing reels of film and piecing it together.  Thankfully software 
makes the whole process much more manageable.

There are three main jobs of video editing:

1.  Remove mistakes or unwanted sections
2.  Keep the video moving at an engaging pace
3.  Insert supporting footage, audio, or titles

Use these three points as a checklist as you edit.

Computer
--------
Video editing does not require an expensive machine, especially if you are a 
beginner.  It would be best if you had a decent monitor and graphics card.  If 
you have an older computer, check your system specifications against OpenShot's 
`minimum system requirements <introduction.html#system-requirements>`_ 
to make sure it works for video editing.  Unfortunately, many older computers 
are not fast enough for video editing, and you should upgrade your whole 
system, if possible.


Accessories
-----------
Before beginning a video project, ensure there is enough storage space on your 
computer to save all the necessary clips.  For example, one hour of 
1080i video, such as from a mini-DV camcorder, takes up nearly 42 GB of 
storage.  If your computer's internal storage device cannot store all the 
clips, the solution is to buy an external drive.

It would help if you had several cables, usually Firewire or USB, to connect 
your computer, external hard drive, and a camera.  Different computers and 
cameras accept other connectors, so check your manuals before buying 
anything.

Practical Tips
--------------
Becoming a great video editor isn’t effortless, but with practice and patience, 
you’ll be editing like a professional in no time. Here are a few of the 
essential tips and techniques you need to know to become a skilled video editor.


#. Pick the Right Computer
    While having a great computer won’t necessarily make you a great video 
    editor, a faster computer will allow you to focus more of your time on the 
    story you’re trying to tell rather than your computer rendering. Everyone 
    has their own opinions about what computer is best for editing, but it all 
    depends on your own preferences.

#. Keep Shooting
    Record more video that you think you will need for your project.  Include 
    video that enhances the scene, sets a mood, or tells a story.  You can use 
    the extra video for smooth transitions in your project.  If you are 
    comfortable using multiple devices, use two devices simultaneously the 
    insert video from either device into your project.

#. Organize Your Project Files
    Composition is the key to success, whether you are running Linux, on a Mac, 
    or a Windows machine.  Be sure to label video files, audio files, and even 
    still images clearly and keep all your clips on the same device and in the 
    same folder for easy access.  OpenShot tries to keep up with your clips, 
    but if you move them after your project is saved, you could lose your 
    entire project.  Organizing before you begin editing can be very 
    advantageous.
 
#. Watch Everything
    Watching everything is the first step in the editing process.  Writer and 
    filmmaker David Andrew Stoler says there is gold in the most unlikely of 
    places: "Some of the most beautiful expressions you're going to get from 
    the actors are after the cut."

#. Edit for a Story
    Remember that as you edit, you are telling a story.  Editing is so much
    more than merely cutting footage and adding effects.  It is an opportunity 
    to take your audience on a journey.  Whether you are editing a complex 
    narrative film or only putting together a personal video, you tell a more 
    in-depth story.

#. Keyboard Shortcuts
    One of the easiest ways to tell the difference between and professional 
    video editor and a novice is to simply look at how much they use the 
    keyboard.  Editors that have been in the business for some time know that a 
    few seconds saved add up over the length of the project.

#. Learn the Lingo
    Video editing is not just a hobby or a profession; it is an industry.  And 
    just like any industry, there is a ton of jargon to learn.  Practically 
    speaking, you do not need to know all the terms on 
    `this list <glossary.html#definitions>`_  to become a better video editor, 
    but a fundamental knowledge of the terms may help you communicate better 
    with other video editors or clients.

#. Assemble, Then Make a Rough Cut
    Drag and drop all your video footage into a timeline and make sure your 
    frame size and frame rates are consistent.  Begin a new timeline and 
    drag-and-drop the best clips into what becomes your assembly cut.  Remember 
    to save your work frequently, and notate the date and time of each version.
    
#. Refine Your Video
    In this phase, your rough cut begins to resemble a cohesive project.
    Adjust the sound and color, make sure the dialog is audible, and add music,
    titles, or graphics in this phase.  Color correction is the process of 
    setting your footage to a color baseline.  No matter how great your subject 
    looks on set, you will almost always need to do some basic post-processing 
    for a consistent video.
 
#. Refine Some More
    A slow scene can set the mood and add tension or it can bore an audience.  
    A fast scene can add adrenaline to your audience’s systems or it can give 
    them headaches.  Some editors cut their projects several different ways 
    before they find the right pace.  Do not let cutting your project several 
    times discourage you.
    
Exporting
---------
People view most of their projects on phones, tablets, or computers, so it is 
essential to know how to export for the web.  The goal when exporting a video 
for the web is to create the highest quality possible with the smallest file 
size.  Four main factors determine the file size of your finished video:

* Codec: 
   A codec determines the type of file format (MP4, AVI, MOV).  The more 
   compression performed by the codec, the smaller your video’s size.  Videos 
   that are smaller in file size tend to be lower in visual quality.
* Resolution: 
   Resolution refers to the number of horizontal and vertical pixels (dots on 
   display) your video contains.  For example, a 4K UHD (2160P) video has four 
   times the resolution of FHD (1080P) video.  A higher resolution means more 
   information to store so that you will have larger file sizes.
* Bit Rate: 
   The Bit Rate is the measure of the speed of data processing of your video.
   A higher bit rate means higher-quality video and larger files.  OpenShot 
   allows you to manually set the Bit Rate / Quality in the Advanced tab of the 
   Export Video window.
* Frame Rate: 
   The frequency (in Hz) at which consecutive images, called frames, appear on 
   the display is the Frame Rate.  Typically, you export your video in the film 
   standard (24fps) or the TV broadcast standard of 30fps (or 25fps in PAL).  
   While there is not much wiggle room here, you should note that if you decide 
   to export your video in 48fps, 50fps, or 60fps, your file size doubles.

Over time you’ll learn which export settings are best for you. But if you’re 
starting, don’t worry — most of the online distributors have created 
`recommended export settings 
<https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171?hl=en>`_.  Using these tips, 
you can ensure your videos are the highest quality possible.
