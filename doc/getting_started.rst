Getting Started
===============
Knowing how to edit videos is an essential part of creating great videos, and you don't need to be a trained videographer to know how to do it well. Simple editing can keep your viewers watching for longer, and add a professional feel to your videos even if you aren't a professional video editor.

On a basic level, video editing is taking footage, cutting it up, removing the pieces you don't want, and keeping the pieces you do. Back in the old days, this was done by literally slicing film reel and piecing it together. Thankfully software makes the whole process a lot easier.

There are three main jobs video editing needs to do:

1. Remove mistakes or unwanted sections
2. Keep the video moving at an engaging pace
3. Insert supporting footage, audio or titles

These three points could be seen as a checklist for you as edit.

Practical tips

1. Organize your footage
    Whether you’re running Linux, on a Mac or a Windows machine, organization is the key to success. Be sure to label video files, audio files, and even still images clearly and keep them on the same drive for easy access.
 
2. Watch everything
    This is the first step in the editing process. Writer and filmmaker David Andrew Stoler says there’s gold to be found in the unlikeliest of places: "Some of the most beautiful expressions you’re going to get from the actors are after the cut.”

3. Assemble, then make a rough cut
    Drag and drop all of your video footage into a timeline and make sure your frame size and frame rates are consistent. Begin a new timeline and drag and drop the best takes into what will become your assembly cut. Remember to frequently save your work in the cloud and on a hard drive, and to note the date and time of each version.
 
4. Refine
    This is where your rough cut starts to resemble a cohesive work. Adjust the sound and color, make sure the dialogue is audible, and add music, titles, or graphics in this phase.
 
5. Refine some more.
    Pacing can make or break a film. A slow scene can ratchet up tension or bore the audience to tears. A fast scene can raise the audience’s heart rates or just give them headaches. Some editors cut scenes several different ways before they find the right pacing, so don’t be disheartened if you have to recut a few
