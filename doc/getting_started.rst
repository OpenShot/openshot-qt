Getting Started
===============
Knowing how to edit videos is an essential part of creating great videos, and you do not need to be a trained videographer to understand how to do it well.  Simple editing can keep your viewers watching for longer, and add a professional feel to your videos even if you are not a professional video editor.

On a basic level, video editing is taking footage, cutting it up, removing the pieces you do not want, and keeping the bits you do.  Back in the old days, this was done by literally slicing film reel and piecing it together.  Thankfully software makes the whole process a lot easier.

There are three main jobs video editing needs to do:

1. Remove mistakes or unwanted sections
2. Keep the video moving at an engaging pace
3. Insert supporting footage, audio, or titles

Use these three points as a checklist as you edit.

Computer
--------
Video editing does not require an expensive machine, especially if you are a beginner.  It would be best if you had a decent monitor and graphics card, both of which come installed on most new computers.  If you have an older computer, check it against OpenShot's minimum requirements to make sure it works for video editing.  Unfortunately, many older computers are not fast enough for video editing, and you should upgrade your whole system.

Accessories
-----------
Before beginning a video project, make sure there is enough space on your computer to save all the necessary file footage.  For example, one hour of 1080i video like you get from a mini-DV camcorder takes up nearly 42 GB of file storage.  If your computer's internal hard drive or flash memory cannot store all the footage, the solution is to buy an external drive.

It would help if you had several cables, usually Firewire or USB, to connect your computer, external hard drive, and a camera.  Different computers and cameras accept different connectors, so check your manuals before buying anything.

Practical Tips
--------------
#. Keep Shooting
    Shoot more footage than you think you'll need. Include footage that enhances the story or sets the scene. You can use it for smooth transitions in your movie.

#. Organize your footage
    Composition is the key to success, whether you are running Linux, on a Mac, or a Windows machine.  Be sure to label video files, audio files, and even still images clearly and keep them on the same drive for easy access.
 
#. Watch everything
    The first step in the editing process is to watch everything.  Writer and filmmaker David Andrew Stoler says there is gold in the unlikeliest of places: "Some of the most beautiful expressions you're going to get from the actors are after the cut."

#. Assemble, then make a rough cut
    Drag and drop all your video footage into a timeline and make sure your frame size and frame rates are consistent.  Begin a new timeline and drag-and-drop the best takes into what becomes your assembly cut.  Remember to save your work frequently.  Note the date and time of each version.
 
#. Refine
    Your rough cut starts to resemble a cohesive work.  Adjust the sound and color, make sure the dialogue is audible, and add music, titles, or graphics in this phase.
 
#. Refine some more.
    A slow scene can ratchet up tension or bore the audience to tears.  A fast scene can raise the audience's heart rates or give them headaches.  Some editors cut scenes several different ways before they find the right pacing, so do not be disheartened if you must recut a few times.
