Titles
======

Adding text and titles is an important aspect of video editing, and OpenShot comes with an easy to use Title Editor. Use
the Title menu (located in the main menu of OpenShot) to launch the Title Editor. You can also use the keyboard shortcut
**Ctrl+T**.

Overview
--------

   1   Choose a Template   Choose from any available vector title template
   2   Preview Title       Preview your title as you make changes
   3   Title Properties    Change the text, colors, or edit in an advanced SVG image editor (such as Inkscape)
   4   Save                Save and add the title to your project
   ==  ==================  ============

Custom Titles
-------------
OpenShot can use any vector SVG image file as a title template. Just add an SVG image file to your 
*.openshot_qt/title_templates/* folder, and it will appear the next time you open the Title Editor interface. You can
also right click on any SVG files in your **Project Files** panel, and choose **Edit Title** or **Duplicate Title**.

3D Animated Titles
------------------
Adding a 3D animated title is just as easy, using our **Animated Title** dialog. Use the Title menu (located
in the main menu of OpenShot) to launch the Animated Title editor. You can also use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl+B**.

This feature requires the latest version of Blender (https://www.blender.org/download/) be installed, and the OpenShot
**Preferences** updated with the correct path to the Blender executable (for example: */home/USER/blender-2.78/blender*).
