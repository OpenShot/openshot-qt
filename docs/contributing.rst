Did you find a bug?
-------------------

-  **Please check if this bug was already reported** by searching on
   GitHub under `Issues`_.

-  If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem,
   :openshot-issue:`open a new one <new/choose>`.
   Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant
   information as possible, and the steps to reproduce the crash or
   issue.

-  Please **attach log files** if you are reporting a crash. Otherwise,
   we will not be able to determine the cause of the crash.

Please download our latest daily installer:
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
1. `openshot.org/download <https://www.openshot.org/download>`_ - click the '**DAILY BUILDS**' button, then grab the latest build from the list.
   (Use the buttons below to download installers for a different Operating System.)
2. Then enable 'Debug Mode (Verbose)' in the Preferences
3. Quit OpenShot and delete both log files:

   -  **Windows**: OpenShot stores its logs in your user profile
      directory (``%USERPROFILE%``, e.g. ``C:\Users\username\``)

      -  ``%USERPROFILE%/.openshot_qt/openshot-qt.log``
      -  ``%USERPROFILE%/.openshot_qt/libopenshot.log``

   -  **Linux/MacOS**: OpenShot stores its logs in your home directory
      (``$HOME``, e.g. ``/home/username/``)

      -  ``$HOME/.openshot_qt/openshot-qt.log``
      -  ``$HOME/.openshot_qt/libopenshot.log``

4. Re-launch OpenShot and trigger the crash as quickly as possible (to
   keep the log files small)
5. Attach **both** log files
