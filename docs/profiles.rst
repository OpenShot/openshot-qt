Profiles
========

A profile is a collection of common video settings (size, frame rate, aspect ratio, etc...). Profiles are used
during editing, previewing, and exporting to provide a quick way to switch between common combinations of these settings.

Project Profile
---------------

The project profile is used when previewing your project and editing. The default project profile is "HD 720p 24fps".
It is best practice to always switch to your target profile before you begin editing. For example, if you are targeting
1080p 30fps, switch to that profile before you begin editing your project.

Export Profile
--------------

The export profile always defaults to your current project profile, but can be changed to target different profiles.

Custom Profile
--------------
Although OpenShot has more than 70 profiles included by default, you can also create your own custom profiles. Create a
new file in the */.openshot_qt/profiles/* folder. Use the following text as your template (i.e. copy and paste this
into the file):

.. code-block:: python

    description=Custom Profile Name
    frame_rate_num=30000
    frame_rate_den=1001
    width=1280
    height=720
    progressive=1
    sample_aspect_num=1
    sample_aspect_den=1
    display_aspect_num=16
    display_aspect_den=9

Once you restart OpenShot, you will see your custom profile appear in the list of Profiles.
