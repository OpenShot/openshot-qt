## Dependencies

Although installers are much easier to use, if you must build from 
source, here are some tips: 

OpenShot is programmed in Python (version 3+), and thus does not need
to be compiled to run. However, be sure you have the following 
dependencies in order to run OpenShot successfully: 

*  Python 3.0+ (http://www.python.org)
*  PyQt5 (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download5)
*  libopenshot: OpenShot Library (https://github.com/OpenShot/libopenshot)
*  libopenshot-audio: OpenShot Audio Library (https://github.com/OpenShot/libopenshot-audio)
*  FFmpeg or Libav (http://www.ffmpeg.org/ or http://libav.org/)
*  GCC build tools (or MinGW on Windows)

## Launch

To run OpenShot from the command line with an installed `libopenshot`,
use the following syntax:
(be sure the change the path to match the install or repo location 
of openshot-qt)

```sh
cd [openshot-qt folder]
python3 src/launch.py
```
    
To run with a version of `libopenshot` built from source but not installed,
set `PYTHONPATH` to the location of the compiled Python bindings. e.g.:

```sh
cd [libopenshot folder]
mkdir build; cd build; cmake [options] ..; make
    
cd [openshot-qt folder]
PYTHONPATH=[libopenshot folder]/build/src/bindings/python \
python3 src/launch.py
```
